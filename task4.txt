1. When I did a test of HSV vs RGB, I was able to see that HSV worked better than RGB. I used a smaller HSV range around the hue and it was more reliable than RGB

2. When I used a flashlight to change the lighting, the tracking got a but worse, but HSV was still better 

3. When I created a rectangle I was able to detect the dominant color with a small HSV range. the brightness sometimes hurt the result because of glare and exposure of brightness. 

4. when the object was non phone it stayed more consistent than the screen which shifted with more brightness.
